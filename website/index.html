        <p>
            Established in 2018, the Windsor-Essex Cricket League (WECL) is dedicated to promoting cricket among youth,
            international students, and newcomers in the community. As the league grows, it aims to adopt data-driven 
            innovations to enhance player selection and game competitiveness. Currently, team selection is mostly 
            subjective, making it difficult to identify top-performing players. This dashboard presents a performance-based 
            system for evaluating and selecting players using machine learning and player statistics from the 2024 season.
        </p>

        <h2>Player Rankings 2024</h2>
        <p>
            The player rankings were extracted directly from the official WECL website using web scraping with the
            <code>pandas.read_html()</code> function. These rankings provide the raw statistics used to build
            performance evaluations in batting, bowling, and fielding, serving as the analytical foundation of the project.

        <h2>Final Cricket Levels</h2>
        <p>
            To evaluate individual strengths, players were categorized into six performance levels for batting,
            bowling, and fielding using median-based statistical analysis. This leveling system offers a structured,
            unbiased framework to benchmark and compare player capabilities.

        <h2>Confidence Intervals</h2>
        <p>
            An XGBoost classifier was trained to predict the probability of each player fitting specific roles
            such as Batter, Bowler, Fielder, All-Rounder, or Wicketkeeper. These confidence scores provide
            an objective assessment of a player’s most likely role based on performance levels.
        </p>

        <h2>Dream 11 Team</h2>
        <p>
            The Dream 11 team was formed by selecting players with the highest confidence scores in each role,
            ensuring a balanced squad. This approach supports fair and strategic decision-making in team selection,
            aligning with WECL’s mission to embrace analytics for modern cricket management.
