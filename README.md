# WECL Performance Analysis Tool
Currently, team selection in WECL is based on subjective assessments, limiting the ability to identify top-performing players with precision. Without a structured performance evaluation system, teams may struggle to optimize their lineups, and players may lack clear benchmarks for improvement. To address this challenge, this project aims to develop a predictive model for selecting the Dream 11 team using a leveling system based on batting, bowling, and fielding scores.
By analyzing player performance data for the year 2024, this model will provide an objective framework for ranking and selecting players, ensuring fair competition and improved decision-making for teams. The implementation of this model will enhance the leagueâ€™s competitiveness and serve as a foundation for future advancements in cricket analytics, positioning WECL as a pioneer in data-driven sports management.
